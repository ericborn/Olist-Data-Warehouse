# Olist Data Warehouse
## Data warehouse development project
This project involved data from the Brazilian online shopping platform Olist. I wanted to develop a data warehouse based on the sales transaction data from September 2016 to October 2018.

The goal of the warehouse was to enable quick reporting on stats such as the top sellers or products by volume or revenue, sales trends by region or by product, etc.

### Original dataset
